           <h3>The diet of a panda</h3>
            <p>
              The giant panda’s diet is too rigid to risk the energy loss that accompanies a seasonal molt. Instead, the giant panda undergoes a continuous molt. This type of molting takes a much smaller and steadier toll on the pandas’ energy level.  Molting gives the pandas a patchy appearance.  People often associate the patchiness with poor health, when really, it is healthy and normal.
            </p>
            <p>In the hot summer, they are fed ice with apples inside it to cool them down. The food is strictly selected, going through several rounds of examination before being fed to pandas, to make sure the pandas get enough nutrition, and for the safety of pandas.
             <p> <a href="https://www.pandasinternational.org/education-2/panda-facts/">Giant Pandas</a> leave scent marks in their territories. The scent marks serve as a major form of communication. Giant Pandas can determine from the scent if another Giant Panda is in the area, if the other Giant Panda is male or female, how recently they left their mark, and, in the case of females, if they are in a reproductive period.

     <p>The mother holds the cub to her chest, much like a human mother. In size, compared to their mothers, panda cubs are some of the smallest newborns. Giant Panda cubs are especially vulnerable since the mothers don’t use a den and hibernate as other bears do. In the wild, Giant Pandas nest in hollow tree trunks or caves. The newborns won’t be able to even stand on their own for nearly 4 months. New mothers occasionally don’t seem to know how to take care of their cubs. In captivity, they are then raised by caretakers using incubators in the nurseries at the Giant Panda Reserves or Zoos. </p>
     <p>At the Giant Panda Reserves, the caretakers in the nursery leave one cub with the mother for her to care for and place one in the nursery in an incubator. In the nursery, the staff will hand feed the cub and stay with it 24 hours a day, every day. After about a week, the cubs are exchanged or “swapped” so both cubs will bond with their mother and receive her care. The mother accepts both babies, but only one at a time. This process of exchanging the cubs, which was developed at the Wolong Panda Center, allows both of the cubs to survive in captivity. The Wolong Panda Center now has a 90% survival rate with captive born cubs, due in large part to this method used to raise twins.</p>
