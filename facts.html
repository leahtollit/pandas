           <h3>The diet of a panda</h3>
            <p>
              The giant panda’s diet is too rigid to risk the energy loss that accompanies a seasonal molt. Instead, the giant panda undergoes a continuous molt. This type of molting takes a much smaller and steadier toll on the pandas’ energy level.  Molting gives the pandas a patchy appearance.  People often associate the patchiness with poor health, when really, it is healthy and normal.
            </p>
            <p>In the hot summer, they are fed ice with apples inside it to cool them down. The food is strictly selected, going through several rounds of examination before being fed to pandas, to make sure the pandas get enough nutrition, and for the safety of pandas.
             <p> <a href="https://www.pandasinternational.org/education-2/panda-facts/">Giant Pandas</a> leave scent marks in their territories. The scent marks serve as a major form of communication. Giant Pandas can determine from the scent if another Giant Panda is in the area, if the other Giant Panda is male or female, how recently they left their mark, and, in the case of females, if they are in a reproductive period.

     <p>Giant Pandas are known around the world for their unique black and white appearance. They resemble other bears in their shape, but have very distinctive markings. All Giant Pandas have black patches around their eyes and black ears on a white head. Their legs are black and there is a black band across their backs. Their mid sections are also white. It is very difficult to tell Giant Pandas apart since their markings are basically the same on all animals. Caretakers can identify individual Giant Pandas by small markings around their mouth or muzzle.</p>
